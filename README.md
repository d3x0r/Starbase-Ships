Vigil-EmptyFrame.fbe - testing engine module structure; modifications in progress, required radiators, and the 
actual built version had to be manually modified; need to remove some thrusters(?).
- Thrusters, generator, cockpit; how fast is the fastest thing?  *spoiler - depressingly slow compared to everything else*

Vigil-ResearchVessel.fbe - Vigil RV - Initial upgrade of vigil frame to support some utility, and
beams to support rigid bolting of ore onto the sides (ore is 5:4 ratio of size, sortof).

- beam structure for bolting extra ore - 120 extra slots (4*20+4*10).
- 2 mining lasers 1 ore collectr
- 2 tractor beams
- 3 spots to mount cargo locks (empty frames, never completed the mods on the BP)
- warp core
- requires a crafting bench or 2 mounted for balance.

Vigil-BoxFrame - Vigil BF - Replaced beams with cargo lock frames that can hold ore instead - single button locks and unlocks; 
- 40 working crates
- 256(54*4+4*9) ore in cargo frames; frames are slighly larger than ore blocks and other things like warp cores or thrusters
could be carried.

- warp core
- requires a crafting bench or 2 mounted for balance.
- long distance
